    <p>
      This beef kebab recipe made from beef marinated in steak sauce, pineapple,
      and worcestershire go great with the peppers and cucumbers they are
      grilled with. The grill combined with the marinate will make a crispy
      outside, and tender inside.

    <h2>Ingredient List</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 zucchini, cut into chunks</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons steak sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
      <li>¼ cup water</li>
      <li>1 ½ pounds beef sirloin, cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
      <li>12 bamboo skewers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the zucchini, bell pepper, and pineapple in a mixing bowl. Drizzle
        with olive oil, and toss to coat. Divide the mixture into freezer bags.
        Whisk the ketchup, salt, steak sauce, sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire
        sauce, and water together in the same bowl until smooth. Add the beef
        cubes, and toss until evenly coated. Divide the beef into freezer bags.
        Seal, and freeze the bags.
      </li>
      <li>
        To cook: take as many bags as you need from the freezer, and thaw in the
        refrigerator overnight, or at least 8 hours. Soak the skewers in warm
        water at least 30 minutes, or place into water when you begin thawing
        the meat and vegetable packets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
        Make the skewers by alternating beef, vegetables, and pineapple on the
        skewers. Discard any remaining marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the skewers on the preheated grill, turning occasionally until
        cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 10 minutes total for
        medium-rare.
      </li>
    </ol>
