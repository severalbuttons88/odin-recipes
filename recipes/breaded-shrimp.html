    <p>Easy to make breaded shrimp, a great appetizer.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>4 cups shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
      <li>2 cups dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Working one at a time, dip shrimp into beaten egg, allowing any excess
        egg to drip back into the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat both
        sides. Place the breaded shrimp, unstacked, onto a plate. Repeat with
        remaining shrimp.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower breaded shrimp carefully into preheated oil in batches. Fry until
        crispy and golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper
        towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining breaded shrimp.
      </li>
    </ol>
